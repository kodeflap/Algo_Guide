# About

The Algo Guide is an educative android app for studying data structures and algorithms. The app includes algorithm concepts and uses simple visual elements like charts, and other visual elements to simplify the understanding of the working of each algorithm like searching, sorting, etc. The app will also be included with code simultaneously to understand the concepts.

# General Info

- Different algorithm concepts
- Visualise the best way to make it understandable
- Embedded code to each algorithm concepts
- Making user interface using Jetpack Compose
- Implementing ViewModel concepts


# Project Status

🚧🚧 Project is: In progress. check out the progress
